    <h1>Hi, It's Me :)</h1>
    <p><strong>A small chunk of my life:</strong> I grew up on a farm. My father owned a vineyard/farm, and I spent my childhood picking three different types of grapes, surrounded by chickens, ducks, cows, carabaos, and nature. It was a pretty decent childhood for the most part. I’ve always been curious about the world, especially science and technology. I loved watching documentaries about space, geography, natural history, and ancient civilizations. Yeah… I guess you could say I was a bit of a geek early on.</p>

  <p>I'm an introvert and a good listener. I enjoy talking to people I vibe with, those who are on the same wavelength. Now that I'm older, I try to be more outgoing so I can express myself better. But deep down, I’m still that introverted, mysterious person who keeps a lot to myself. I’ve always been that way, especially in my early 20s. I don’t like oversharing, and I tend to carry my thoughts with care and quiet strength.</p>

  <p>I geek out on a lot of things. I listen to a mix of music—from singer-songwriters and chill DJs to pop, folk-pop, hip hop, and more. Lately, I’ve been hooked on <em>The Story of Us</em> by Gracie Abrams—surprisingly, I love it! But I’m still a Swiftie at heart. I also loved Avicii and still play some iconic tracks from Zedd and Calvin Harris.</p>

  <p>These days, I enjoy spending time alone. Growing up is hard, and it’s definitely not a straight path. But I try, day by day, to stay grounded in reality.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">That’s all for now—thanks for reading this, LOL.</p>
