    <h1>Enduring Silence</h1>
    <p>When I was a teenager in school, there was a time I was bullied. I was around 12 or 13. It started with one person who verbally bullied me and, whenever they had the chance, would also hurt me physically. They would spit on my books or try to make me eat things they had handled, even forcing it toward my mouth. I never ate it, but the bullying went on for years. It lasted through my second and third year of high school, four years total, but those two years were the worst.</p>

    <p>I never told my parents or anyone else. I kept it all to myself. I had some classmates I hung out with, but I never felt close enough to open up to them. Teenagers usually avoid serious conversations, and I felt alone. I bottled up everything until I became mentally exhausted. I didn’t want to go to school anymore. I didn’t want to live.</p>

    <p>One day in the shower, I saw a bottle of toilet bowl cleaner and thought about drinking it. I wanted to end everything. I let a single drop touch my tongue and immediately spit it out. I was scared. The idea of dying terrified me, so I stopped. After that, I had no choice but to keep going, to keep showing up at school and surviving each day of bullying.</p>

    <p>Looking back, I realize I was mentally strong for enduring it, but it left a deep mark on me. In my early twenties, I started to see the long-term effects. Because I learned to suppress my emotions for so long, they started to explode in adulthood. Small things would make me angry. I would lash out, say horrible things, even blame God. It was like I was being haunted by everything I had buried for so long.</p>

    <p>It’s not just the anger. I also struggle with anxiety. It chills my back, keeps me awake at night, and makes it hard to focus. I zone out a lot. I find it hard to connect with people. I’m constantly afraid they’ll judge me or hurt me the way others did before. That fear isolates me.</p>

    <p>Now that I’m an adult, I know I need to build relationships, romantic or otherwise, but I find that hard.</p>
